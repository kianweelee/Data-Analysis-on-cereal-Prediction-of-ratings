# Data-Analysis-on-cereal-Prediction-of-ratings
Performing data analysis and building a linear regression model on cereal dataset

## What do we see?
In this dataset, we look into the criteria that determine the ratings of renown cereals. Here, we will answer the question on whether the effect of variables such as calories, sugar, carbohydrates, protein, fibers, sodium, etc is significant on consumer's rating.
